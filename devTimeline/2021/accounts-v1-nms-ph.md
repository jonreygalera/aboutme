## 📅 2021 — Lead Developer

**Project:** Accounts v1 (NMS PH) — *My First Project Leading the Team*

In 2021, I had the opportunity to **lead my first project**, **Accounts v1**, a core account management system for NMS Philippines. The platform provided **Single-Sign-On (SSO)** across multiple internal applications, allowing users to seamlessly access all systems with a single account.  

This was the first time that **decisions were made by me**, from design choices to feature prioritization. It was also my first hands-on experience with **Docker and React.js**, which our senior developers introduced to the team. Applying these technologies in a real project taught me a lot about both frontend and backend architecture.

**What I Did:**
- Gathered requirements and designed a **scalable, reliable accounts platform**  
- Developed core SSO features to unify multiple platforms  
- Built admin and user-facing tools using **React.js** and **Material-UI**  
- Implemented containerized deployment with **Docker** to improve reliability and consistency  
- Led the team in decision-making for features, architecture, and workflow design  

**Tech Stack:**
- Laravel  
- PHP  
- MySQL  
- Redis  
- Docker  
- React.js  
- Material-UI  
- Node.js  

**Key Takeaway:**  
> Accounts v1 was my first project leading the team, where I made key decisions and took full ownership. It taught me **how to lead development, make critical technical choices, and implement new technologies** like Docker and React.js in a production environment.
