# 2021: Leading the Charge

## Accounts v1 (NMS PH)

**Role:** Lead Developer (My First Lead Role!)  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, Docker, React.js, Redis, MySQL

### The Big Leap

This was the turning point. I wasn't just writing tickets anymore; I was **defining** them.
We needed a centralized Single-Sign-On (SSO) system for NMS Philippines. Five different apps, one login.

### Innovation

I took a risk. The team was used to pure PHP/jQuery.
I introduced **Docker** for consistent environments and **React.js** for a modern frontend.
It was a steep learning curve for everyone (including me), but it paid off. We built a scalable, containerized authentication hub that became the backbone of our internal ecosystem.
