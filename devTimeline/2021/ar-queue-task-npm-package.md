**Project:** ar-queue-task (NPM Package)

Out of curiosity and a desire to expand my JavaScript skills, I created my **second NPM package** called **ar-queue-task**. This package was an experiment in implementing a **queue system**, allowing tasks to be managed in a controlled, sequential manner.  

**What I Did:**
- Explored how to create, structure, and publish an NPM package  
- Implemented a simple queue system to manage tasks in JavaScript  
- Tested and published the package ([link here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ar-queue-task))  
- Learned about task queuing, package versioning, and distribution  

**Tech Stack:**
- JavaScript  
- npm  

**Key Takeaway:**
> This project helped me better understand task queuing and reinforced the fundamentals of building and publishing reusable code in the JavaScript ecosystem.
