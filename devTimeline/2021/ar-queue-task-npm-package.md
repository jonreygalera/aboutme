# 2021: Queueing Theory in Practice

## ar-queue-task (npm package)

**Project Type:** Personal Experiment  
**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, npm

### The Curiosity

I was fascinated by how JavaScript handles async tasks. The Event Loop is cool, but what if you need more control? What if you need to limit concurrency?

### The Experiment

I built a lightweight queue system.
It wasn't about building a production-grade library (there are plenty of those). It was about **understanding the mechanics**.
Writing this package forced me to deeply understand Promises, callbacks, and race conditions.
It was "learning by doing" in its purest form.
