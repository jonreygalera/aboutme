## 📅 2021 — Support Lead Developer

**Project:** nmitd/oauth — *My First Private Composer Package*

In 2021, I created **my first private Composer package**, **nmitd/oauth**, designed to **connect multiple platforms to NMS Accounts** for centralized authentication.  

Before this package existed, each platform was manually integrated with NMS Accounts, which was **time-consuming and prone to errors**. I decided to automate this process by building a reusable package that could be integrated quickly and reliably across all systems.  

**What I Did:**
- Developed a system to **connect all platforms to NMS Accounts** via a centralized Composer package  
- Handled **bug fixes, feature requests, and versioning** for internal use  
- Provided guidance to teams on integrating the package into both new and existing systems  
- Maintained and updated the package to ensure **reliability and compatibility**  

**Tech Stack:**
- Laravel  
- PHP  
- MySQL  
- Redis  
- React.js  
- Material-UI  

**Key Takeaway:**  
> Building nmitd/oauth was my first experience creating a **private Composer package**. It taught me how to **identify repetitive workflows, automate processes, and provide a reusable solution** for multiple platforms—making SSO integration much faster, safer, and more consistent. It also gave me confidence in taking initiative and implementing solutions that impact the entire system.
