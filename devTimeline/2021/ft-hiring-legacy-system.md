# 2021: Keeping the Old Guard Alive

## FT Hiring — Legacy Fulltime Recruitment System

**Role:** Maintainer  
**Tech Stack:** CodeIgniter, MySQL, jQuery

### The Challenge

Legacy systems can feel like ancient artifacts. They work… mostly. But maintaining them is tricky—one wrong change, and the whole system could break. FT Hiring was our **core recruitment platform**, and it needed careful attention to keep running smoothly.  

### What I Did

I dove into the **CodeIgniter codebase**, fixing bugs, updating features, and ensuring everything ran reliably. Working with **MySQL and jQuery**, I maintained the interface and ensured the system continued serving daily recruitment operations without disruption.  

### The Takeaway

Maintaining a legacy system taught me **patience, code reading skills, and appreciation for old yet critical systems**. Not every project is flashy, but some of the most impactful work is making sure systems remain **stable, reliable, and ready for everyday use**.
