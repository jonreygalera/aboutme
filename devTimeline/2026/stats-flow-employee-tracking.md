# 2026: Stats Flow — Turning Legacy into Insight

## Stats Flow

**Role:** Lead Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, Filament, Redis, MySQL, Docker  

### The Challenge

Two legacy systems, **Prody** and **Flai**, contained years of employee data.  
The goal: **migrate all this data accurately** into a new system while building a platform that could track employee stats reliably moving forward.

Legacy systems are messy. Data is inconsistent, formats differ, and missing records are common.  

### What I Built

- Developed the **data migration pipeline** to move records from Prody and Flai into a unified schema  
- Ensured **data integrity** and minimal downtime during migration  
- Designed a **modern backend and admin interface** using Laravel and Filament  
- Leveraged **Redis for caching** and **Docker for consistent environments**  

### The Outcome

The migration succeeded without losing critical information, and Stats Flow now provides **real-time insights** on employee statistics.  

This project reinforced how important it is to **understand legacy systems** before building the future—and that careful planning and robust tooling make migration projects much less painful.
