# 2019: Finding My Voice

## CCenterv2

**Role:** Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, MySQL, Angular

### The Story

Fresh out of training, I joined the **CCenterv2** team. Usually, juniors are told what to do. But here, I found my voice.

I didn't just pick up tickets; I started asking "Why?"

- "Why are we structuring the database this way?"
- "Could this angular component be reusable?"

### The Impact

I realized that **soft skills are technical skills**. Being able to articulate _why_ a certain approach is better is just as important as writing the code itself. My inputs started shaping the system's architecture, and I transitioned from a "coder" to a "collaborator."
