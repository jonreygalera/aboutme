# 2019: Leading Without Authority

## iTEaCH: Mobile Scanner for Kids

**Role:** Team Lead (Thesis)  
**Tech Stack:** Java, OpenCV (Android)

### The Story

"Build an app that uses camera vision to teach kids shapes and colors."
Sounds cute, right? **It was a nightmare.**

Getting OpenCV to run smoothly on 2019-era mid-range Android phones was a performance battle. We dealt with lag, crash loops, and lighting issues.

### The Leadership Lesson

As the team lead, my biggest challenge wasn't the code—it was the **team**. Keeping everyone motivated when things weren't working, unblocking stuck members, and cutting features to meet the deadline.
We didn't launch on the Play Store, but seeing a teacher successfully use it in a demo was a massive win.
