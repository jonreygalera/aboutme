## 📅 2019 — Thesis / Research Project (Team Lead)

**Project:** iTEaCH: A Mobile Scanner for Shape and Color for Kids Learning

For my thesis, I led a small team to develop **iTEaCH**, an Android application designed to help children learn **shapes and colors** through mobile scanning and computer vision.

**What I Did:**

- Led the team, coordinated tasks, and ensured project milestones were met
- Designed and implemented the app’s core functionality using **Java** and **OpenCV**
- Applied computer vision techniques to recognize shapes and colors in real-time
- Focused on usability for teachers and children, ensuring the app was intuitive
- Deployed the app to teachers’ phones for testing, though it was not officially released on Google Play
- Learned valuable lessons in project management, team coordination, and delivering a working prototype

**Tech Stack:**

- Java
- OpenCV

**Key Takeaway:**

> Leading this project taught me how to balance coding, team leadership, and user-focused design. Even though the app wasn’t fully released, seeing it installed and used by teachers made the effort tangible and meaningful.
