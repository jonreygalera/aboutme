# 2019: Learning from the Past

## Legacy HRapps

**Role:** Junior Developer  
**Tech Stack:** CodeIgniter, MySQL, jQuery

### The Story

"Legacy code" often gets a bad rap. But on **HRapps**, it was my textbook.
I spent months reading code written by developers who came before me.

- Why did they use this pattern?
- How did they handle session management in CodeIgniter?

### The Takeaway

I learned that code is read 10x more than it is written.
Maintaining this system taught me empathy for the next developer. Now, when I write code, I ask myself: _"Will the person reading this in 2 years want to find me and yell at me?"_
If the answer is yes, I refactor.
