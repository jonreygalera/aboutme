# 2019: The Proving Ground

## Blog Post System (Training Project)

**Role:** Trainee  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, PHP, MySQL

### The Story

This wasn't just a "training exercise"—it was my interview. I had to prove to NMS Philippines that I could write clean, scalable code.

I didn't just build a CRUD app; I over-engineered it (in a good way). I implemented design patterns I'd only read about, ensuring the architecture could handle "theoretical" scale.

### The Result

This project was my ticket in. It showed the senior developers that I didn't just know _how_ to code, but _why_ to structure it a certain way. It got me the job.
