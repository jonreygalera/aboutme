## 📅 2019 — Developer at NMS Philippines

**Project:** Flai

At **NMS Philippines**, I contributed to the development and maintenance of **Flai**, a system that required handling both **new advanced features** and existing **legacy code**. I had the opportunity to **share ideas**, **participate in system decisions**, and tackle technically challenging tasks.  

**What I Did:**
- Built advanced features like an **examination system** integrated with other APIs  
- Developed a **bulk email system**, learning limitations and best practices for large-scale email sending  
- Maintained and improved the **legacy system**, understanding and refactoring existing code  
- Participated in discussions on system architecture and feature planning  
- Applied problem-solving to both new development and maintenance tasks  

**Tech Stack:**
- Kohana / PHP  
- MySQL  
- jQuery  

**Key Takeaway:**
> Working on Flai taught me how to balance new feature development with legacy system maintenance, and how understanding existing code is just as valuable as writing new code.
