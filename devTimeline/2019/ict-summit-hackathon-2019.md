# March 2019: City of San Fernando, La Union — ICT Summit

## First Hackathon Experience

**Event:** ICT Summit Hackathon  
**Role:** Co-Lead of Development (Representing our school)  
**Duration:** 24 Hours  
**Tech Stack:** Vanilla PHP, Bootstrap  

March 2019 was my **first ever hackathon**.

We represented our school and had only 24 hours to conceptualize, design, and build working applications from scratch.

We didn’t win the competition —  
but that experience shaped me more than I expected.

### What We Built

Within 24 hours, we built **two functional applications** focused on solving real community problems.

#### 1️⃣ Farming Inventory & Sales System  
A system designed for:
- Farmers  
- Local government units  

The goal was to:
- Track agricultural inventory  
- Monitor sales  
- Improve transparency between farmers and the government  
- Help digitize small-scale farming operations  

#### 2️⃣ Government Queueing System with SMS Notifications  

A queue management system for government transactions that:
- Assigns queue numbers  
- Sends SMS notifications to citizens  
- Reduces physical waiting time  
- Improves transaction flow inside government offices  

The idea was simple:  
Less waiting.  
Less crowding.  
More efficiency.

### More Context (The Hidden Pressure)

During this time, if I remember correctly, I was also the **leader of our research/thesis group**.

So while preparing for a 24-hour hackathon,  
I was also making sure our thesis progress stayed on track.

Balancing:
- Academic responsibilities  
- Team coordination  
- Hackathon preparation  
- Development tasks  

It was one of my first real lessons in **time management and responsibility**.

And honestly, the sleepless night during that event **leveled up my programming skills**.

When you’re forced to debug at 3AM, optimize under pressure, and ship something that *must* work before the deadline — you learn fast.

No frameworks.  
No shortcuts.  
Just raw PHP, Bootstrap, caffeine, and pure determination.

### What I Learned

We didn’t bring home the trophy.

But I gained something more valuable:
- Building under extreme time pressure  
- MVP-first thinking  
- Leadership under stress  
- Balancing multiple major responsibilities  
- Delivering working software fast  

That 24-hour sprint — while juggling thesis leadership — made me realize:

I genuinely love building systems that solve real problems.

And maybe…

That was the real win.
