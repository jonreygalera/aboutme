# 2024: GTranslate — Making Multilingual Easy

## GTranslate

**Role:** Lead Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, PHP, MySQL, Redis, React.js, TailwindCSS, shadcn, Google Translate API  

### The Challenge

Localization is tedious.  
When your system handles multiple languages, translating content manually is a **nightmare**.  

Teams needed a tool to **process bulk translations efficiently**, while ensuring accuracy and logging for audit and review.

### What I Built

As lead developer, I implemented:
- **Bulk upload and automatic translation** using Google Translate API  
- Accurate handling of multiple language entries  
- Backend integration for **task processing, error handling, and logging**  
- Minor feature enhancements to improve usability and workflow  

### Collaboration

Worked closely with the UI team using **TailwindCSS and shadcn** to make the interface simple and intuitive, even for non-technical users.

### The Outcome

GTranslate significantly reduced manual translation work, improved consistency, and allowed teams to focus on content rather than mechanics.  

Automation + smart tooling = happy teams and faster localization.
