# 2024: Learning by Teaching

## NPM / Composer Packages Mentorship

**Role:** Mentor (Still Learning, Still Sharing)  
**Focus:** Package structure, publishing, versioning, best practices  

### The Honest Truth

I’m not 100% an expert in building the most secure and hyper-optimized packages.  
I’m still learning.

But I’ve built enough — npm packages, Composer packages, internal tools — to understand the real-world process.

And sometimes, that’s enough to help someone else move forward.

### The Moment

Some of my colleagues were curious about creating reusable packages.  
Instead of keeping what I knew to myself, I shared:

- How to structure a package properly  
- Versioning principles (why breaking changes matter)  
- Publishing workflows  
- Real mistakes I made so they don’t repeat them  

### Why It Matters

Teaching forced me to clarify my own understanding.  
Explaining dependency management, semantic versioning, and package design made me sharper.

It reminded me of something simple:

You don’t have to be the best in the room to help someone.  
You just need to be one step ahead — and willing to share.

And honestly?  
Watching teammates publish their own packages felt just as rewarding as publishing mine.
