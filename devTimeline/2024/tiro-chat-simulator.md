# 2024: Tiro Chat Simulator — Showcasing Real-Time Magic

## Tiro Chat Simulator

**Role:** Lead Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, PHP, MySQL, Redis, React.js, MUI  

### The Opportunity

Since we had already developed the chat system for NMS Exam, the team was given a new challenge: **create a chat simulator for client demos**.  

I was thrilled. This wasn’t just internal tooling—it was a chance to **showcase our work to the world**.

### Building the Demo

The simulator needed to:
- Demonstrate real-time messaging and responsiveness  
- Handle multiple clients and conversations seamlessly  
- Reflect the reliability of the systems we built for exams  

We worked closely with a **web designer** to implement **different themes**, making the simulator visually appealing and flexible for various demo contexts.  
Additionally, we made it **embed-friendly** using **iframe integration**, so it could be deployed across different websites without extra setup.  

I led the development and maintenance of the simulator, adapting our existing chat architecture to highlight its capabilities.

### The Outcome

The demo worked flawlessly.
Clients could see **real-time interactions** as if it were a live system.
The different themes and iframe embedding added polish and flexibility, showing the system’s adaptability and ease of integration.

### Reflection

It was exciting to take a project originally built for exams and **repurpose it for demos**, showing how engineering work can have multiple lives.  

Sometimes, the most rewarding projects aren’t the biggest systems—they’re the ones that make people *actually see* what you’ve built.
