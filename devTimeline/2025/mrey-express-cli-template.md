# 2025: mrey-express-cli — My Personal Express Template

## Express CLI Template

**Role:** Creator & Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express.js  

### The Motivation

I was tired of **starting every Express project from scratch**.  
Being a **Laravel-first developer** (hehe), I naturally followed some Laravel-inspired conventions.  
Not everything is “god-tier,” but it’s practical and saves time.

### What I Built

- A **CLI template for Express.js projects**  
- Scaffolding that sets up folders, configs, and basic boilerplate  
- Inspired by **Laravel structure**, lightweight and flexible  
- Published as **npm package**: [@mreycode/mrey-express-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mreycode/mrey-express-cli)  

### Fun Twist

I was **amazed**—just 2 weeks after publishing, the package had **600+ downloads**!  
Maybe a bot downloaded it? 😄  

### The Outcome

Starting a new Express project is almost **instant**.  
No more repetitive setup, just scaffold, tweak, and code.  

It’s not perfect, but it’s **my workflow enhancer**—and every iteration makes it better.
