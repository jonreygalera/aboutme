# 2025: Portfolio Website — From Experimentation to Showcase

## Portfolio Website

**Role:** Fullstack Developer & Designer  
**Tech Stack:** Next.js, Vercel  

### The Journey

I had a previous portfolio hosted on **DigitalOcean** (`jonreygalera.mreys.net`) just for experience.  
It was fun, but expensive for a personal project, so I took it down.

Next, I tried **GitHub Pages** — free, but limited in flexibility.  

Finally, I landed on **Vercel**.  
It offered everything I needed: hosting, CI/CD, serverless functions, and the ability to integrate modern tools like **Next.js** effortlessly.

### What I Built

- A fully responsive portfolio to showcase my Dev Journey, projects, and skills  
- Modern frontend with **Next.js**, leveraging Vercel’s deployment and serverless features  
- Clean structure, easy updates, and fast performance  

### Reflection

Creating this portfolio was more than coding; it was **curating my own story**.  
From trial-and-error with hosting to deploying on Vercel, I learned that **experience, experimentation, and adaptability** are as valuable as any code you write.  

It’s my playground, my showcase, and a tool to inspire curiosity in others — and myself.
