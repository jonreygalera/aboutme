# 2025: AI Agent Engineer — Automating with Intelligence

## AI/Automation Agents

**Role:** Co-Lead AI Agent Engineer  
**Tech Stack:** n8n

### The Challenge

Automation isn’t new—but making it **intelligent** is.  
We wanted agents that could do more than repeat tasks—they needed to **think, fetch, and act** across multiple platforms.

### What We Built

- Built AI/Automation Agents using **n8n** to orchestrate workflows with APIs like **Google, Airtop, Telegram**, and others
- Leveraged AI approaches including **RAG systems** and advanced **prompt engineering** to improve agent responses
- Developed internal tools for AI Agent Engineers:
  - **Workflow generator** for n8n
  - **Prompt generator** for AI tasks
  - Miscellaneous utilities to speed up development

### The Outcome

Our agents could automate complex workflows across platforms, saving hours of manual effort and enabling the team to focus on higher-level tasks.

Working on this project taught me the importance of **systematic AI integration**, tooling, and workflow automation.  
It was about creating **smart systems that help humans work smarter**, not harder.
