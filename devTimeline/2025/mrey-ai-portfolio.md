# 2025: mrey-ai.vercel.app — My AI Portfolio Playground

## AI/Automation Portfolio

**Role:** Fullstack Developer & Experimenter  
**Tech Stack:** Next.js, Vercel, Supabase, Express.js  

### The Idea

I needed a place to **showcase my AI agent and automation projects**.  
I had prior experience building AI tools, so why not combine it into a live portfolio?  

Thus, **mrey-ai.vercel.app** was born.

### Building & Experimenting

- Frontend built on **Next.js**, deployed seamlessly on **Vercel**  
- Backend powered by **Supabase** and **Express.js**, all free!  
- Gradually enhancing features over time — if you’re reading this, maybe it’s already evolved 😄  

### The Fun Part

This wasn’t just a portfolio; it was a **playground**:  
- Testing new AI workflows  
- Showcasing automation experiments  
- Learning deployment, integration, and free-stack tooling  

### Reflection

Sometimes, the best projects are **the ones you’re actively evolving**, not just finished products.  
It’s live. It’s playful. And it’s yours to tinker with — exactly how I like my dev journey to be.
