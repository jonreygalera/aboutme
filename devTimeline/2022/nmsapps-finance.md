# 2022: Where Mistakes Cost Real Money

## NMSAPPS Finance

**Role:** Lead Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, PHP, MySQL, Redis, Docker, React.js, MUI, Node.js

### The Stakes

Finance systems are different.
A bug here doesn’t just break a page—it breaks trust.

NMSAPPS Finance became the backbone for **payroll, loans, and HR financial reporting**. Salaries, deductions, 13th-month pay—everything employees care deeply about passed through this system.

There was no room for guesswork.

### Building the Core

I led the system end-to-end, from **architecture to deployment**.
We designed workflows for payroll processing, loan management, and detailed reports that HR and accounting could rely on without second-guessing the numbers.

Accuracy mattered more than speed.
Every calculation was reviewed. Every edge case questioned.

### Migration Reality Check

One of the hardest parts wasn’t building new features—it was **migrating finance data from the legacy HR apps**.
Old data is messy. Assumptions are wrong. Numbers don’t always add up.

As co-lead of the migration, I learned how to respect historical data while still moving forward.
It was less about writing clever code and more about **understanding the business rules behind every peso**.

### What This Taught Me

This project changed how I think as a developer.
I stopped asking, “Does this work?”
I started asking, **“Can people trust this?”**

When you build systems that handle money, clarity, auditability, and discipline matter more than fancy abstractions.
And when payday arrives without issues—that’s the real success metric.
