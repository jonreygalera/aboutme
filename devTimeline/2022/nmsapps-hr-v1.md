# 2022: The System Everyone Used (and Complained About)

## NMSAPPS HR v1

**Role:** Co-Lead Developer  
**Lifecycle:** Archived  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, PHP, MySQL, React.js, MUI

### Why This System Mattered

Unlike finance or moderation tools, HR systems are personal.
Every employee touches them—profiles, attendance, requests, approvals.
If something feels slow or confusing, people notice immediately.

NMSAPPS HR v1 became the **central HR platform** before newer versions replaced it.
For a long time, this was _the_ system employees relied on daily.

### Building the Foundation

As co-lead, I helped design and build the **core HR modules**:
employee profiles, attendance tracking, and internal workflow tools that supported day-to-day operations.

A big part of my role was implementing **backend logic that everything depended on**.
These weren’t flashy features, but they were the parts that broke the entire system if done wrong.

### The Migration Nobody Sees

The most critical work happened behind the scenes.
I created the migration scripts to move HR data from the legacy HR apps into a new Laravel-based platform.

Legacy HR data is fragile.
Dates don’t line up. Fields change meaning. Some records exist only because “that’s how it used to be.”

As co-lead of the migration, my job was to make sure **no employee history was lost**, even if the old system was messy.
That responsibility stays with you.

### Day-to-Day Reality

Beyond building features, I was involved in:

- Feature planning and requirement clarification
- Architecture decisions with the team
- Maintenance, debugging, and incremental improvements

HR systems don’t get applause.
If people don’t complain, that means you did your job right.

### Looking Back

NMSAPPS HR v1 is now archived, but it taught me something important:
systems don’t need to be perfect—they need to be **dependable**.

When a system becomes invisible to its users, that’s usually a sign it’s doing exactly what it should.
