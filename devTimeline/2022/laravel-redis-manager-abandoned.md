# 2022: Laravel Redis Manager — The Abandoned Dream

## Redis Experiment

**Role:** Curious Junior Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, Redis, Composer  

### The Idea

I was **amazed by Redis**—so fast, so versatile.  
I thought: “What if I could make a Composer package that works like an **Eloquent model**, but for Redis?”  

No more manually doing `get`, `set`, or formatting data—everything handled cleanly through a model-like interface.

Remember, **I wasn’t a senior yet**—just a wondering junior programmer exploring ideas.  
Maybe it’s already been made, or maybe **you’re reading this**. 😄

### The Reality

- Started building the package: [laravel-redis-manager-dev](https://github.com/jonreygalera/laravel-redis-manager-dev)  
- Got stuck juggling **pressure from other projects and life**  

### The Outcome

I abandoned it. 😅  
Sometimes, even the best ideas need to **wait for the right time**.  

But the concept stuck with me, and maybe one day I’ll revisit it—**Redis + Eloquent-style abstraction**, ready to rock.
