# 2022: Waiting for Builds Was No Longer Acceptable

## From Webpack to Vite

**Focus:** Frontend Tooling & Developer Experience  
**Tech Stack:** Vite, JavaScript, React.js

### The Pain Point

At some point, you stop blaming your laptop.
Cold builds were slow. Hot reloads weren’t really “hot.”
Every small UI change meant waiting, breaking focus, and losing momentum.

Webpack worked—but it felt heavy.
And the project was growing.

### The Shift

In 2022, we transitioned parts of our frontend setup from **Webpack to Vite**.
The goal wasn’t to chase trends.
It was simple: **make feedback faster**.

Suddenly:
- Dev servers started almost instantly
- Hot reloads actually felt real-time
- Frontend iteration became enjoyable again

### What Changed for Me

This transition reminded me that tooling choices matter.
Not just for performance, but for **how developers feel while working**.

Less waiting meant:
- More experimentation
- Faster bug fixing
- Better collaboration between frontend and backend

### Takeaway

Good tools don’t make you smarter.
They make it easier to stay in flow.

And once you experience fast builds, it’s hard to go back.
