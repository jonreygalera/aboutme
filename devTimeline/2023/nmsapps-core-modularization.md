# 2023: When One System Became Many

## NMSAPPS Core Development

**Role:** Co-Lead Developer · Lead Developer (Finance Module)  
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, PHP, MySQL, Redis, React.js, MUI

### The Growing Pain

NMSAPPS was getting bigger.
HR, Finance, Attendance—everything lived together, tightly coupled.
Every change felt heavier than it should have.

We didn’t have a feature problem.
We had a **structure problem**.

### The Shift to Modular Thinking

In 2023, we modularized NMSAPPS into clear domains:
- HR
- Finance
- Attendance

Each module had defined boundaries, responsibilities, and ownership.
The goal wasn’t microservices—it was **clarity**.

As co-lead, I helped shape how these modules interacted.
As lead of the **Finance module**, I owned its logic, and long-term direction.

### Leading the Finance Module

Finance isn’t forgiving.
Payroll, loans, reports—mistakes show up in real life, not just logs.

I led the development of the Finance module with a focus on:
- Clear business rules
- Predictable data flows
- Features that accounting teams could trust

Decisions here weren’t about elegance.
They were about correctness.

### What Changed

After modularization:
- Development moved faster
- Bugs stayed contained
- Teams could reason about changes without fear

The system finally felt like it was built to grow.

### Reflection

This phase pushed me beyond feature delivery.
It forced me to think in **systems**, not tickets.

Breaking the monolith wasn’t about technology.
It was about making complexity manageable—for developers and for the business.
