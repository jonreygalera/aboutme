# 2020: ATM Card Design — Just My Phone & HTML/CSS

## ATM Card Variants

**Role:** Solo Experimenter  
**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS  

### The Context

No personal PC.  
Just my **low-key Android phone** and a curious mind.  

I thought: “Can I make ATM card designs **just with HTML & CSS**?”  
Why not? 😄

### What I Built

- Different **variants of ATM cards**  
- Pure HTML and CSS, responsive enough for fun previews  
- Repo: [ATM Card Design](https://github.com/jonreygalera/atm-card-design-web)  
- Preview online: [HTML Preview](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/jonreygalera/atm-card-design-web/blob/main/index.html)  

### The Outcome

A small, playful project that reminded me **creativity doesn’t need fancy tools**.  
Sometimes all you need is curiosity, your phone, and some CSS magic.  

It’s messy, it’s fun, and it works — the perfect mini side project for a developer still exploring the world.
