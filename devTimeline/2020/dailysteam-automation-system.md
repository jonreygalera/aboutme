# 2020: If It's Repetitive, Automate It

## Dailysteam Automation

**Role:** Support Lead Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express.js, Redis

### The Challenge

Humans are bad at repetitive tasks. We forget. We sleep. We make typos.
Our team needed bot replies to be sent at specific times, every single day. Doing this manually was a recipe for disaster.

### The Solution

I built a bridge—an automation layer that never sleeps.
Using **Redis** for scheduling, I ensured that messages went out exactly when they were supposed to.
It turned a daily headache into a "set it and forget it" system.
Reliability isn't flashy, but it's what keeps businesses running.
