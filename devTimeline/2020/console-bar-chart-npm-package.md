**Project:** console-bar-chart (NPM Package)

Out of curiosity and a desire to learn, I created my **first NPM package** called **console-bar-chart** using **pure JavaScript**. The goal was simple: display bar charts in the console and understand how npm packages are structured, published, and consumed.  

**What I Did:**
- Learned how to structure a JavaScript project for npm  
- Implemented the bar chart functionality in pure JS  
- Published the package to npm ([link here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console-bar-chart))  
- Explored versioning, package metadata, and npm distribution  

**Tech Stack:**
- JavaScript  
- npm  

**Key Takeaway:**
> This experiment taught me how package management works in the JavaScript ecosystem, and encouraged me to explore creating reusable code for the wider developer community.
