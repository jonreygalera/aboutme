# 2020: Hello World in the Terminal

## Console Bar Chart (npm package)

**Project Type:** Personal Side Project  
**Tech Stack:** Pure JavaScript

### The "Why?"

I was curious. How do developers ship code that other developers use? How do libraries work?
I decided to strip everything down. No frameworks. No complex logic. Just: _"Can I make a bar chart appear in a terminal window?"_

### The Result

It worked! [I published it on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console-bar-chart).
Was it useful? Maybe to 5 people.
Was it educational? **Absolutely.**
I learned about semantic versioning, `package.json` metadata, and the thrill of seeing `npm install console-bar-chart` actually do something.
