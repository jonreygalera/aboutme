## 📅 2020 — Developer

**Project:** IM Moderation v1

During 2020, I worked on **IM Moderation v1**, an internal tool built to **monitor and filter content** on our messaging platform. The system had to handle multiple types of content—**text, images, and videos**—and ensure that everything complied with our quality standards.

**My Contributions:**

- Added moderation features to handle different content types reliably
- Improved the system’s performance and stability for consistent filtering
- Worked closely with the team to ensure the tool met internal compliance requirements

**Tech Stack:** 
- Kohana

**What I Learned:**

> This project gave me hands-on experience building systems that manage diverse content. It taught me how to think about **reliability, real-world workflow challenges**, and how even small improvements can make a big difference in content moderation.
