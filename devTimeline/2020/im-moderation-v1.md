# 2020: The Content Police

## IM Moderation v1

**Role:** Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Kohana (PHP)

### The Responsibility

Moderation isn't just about deleting spam. It's about safety.

### The Tech

I added support for diverse content types. This taught me about **handling binary data**, **mime types**, and the sheer volume of data a messaging platform generates.
Every optimization I made here directly impacted thousands of conversations.
