# 2018: The "It Works on My Machine" Era

## DOST: Barangay Portal

**Role:** Co-Lead Developer (Internship)  
**Tech Stack:** PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, Google Maps API

### The Story

This was my first real taste of software engineering. No tutorials, no hand-holding—just a problem statement: _"We need to digitize barangay records."_  

We built the system **from scratch** over two months and delivered it locally to our supervisor for review. Although it wasn’t deployed live, the project gave me invaluable hands-on experience in planning, coding, and testing a complete application.

### What I Learned

- **Greenfield Development:** Starting with a blank editor is both terrifying and liberating.  
- **User Perspective Matters:** Even though it ran only locally, thinking about how barangay officials would use it shaped my design decisions.  
- **Full-Stack Experience:** I acted as the DBA, backend developer, frontend designer, and tester—all in one.
