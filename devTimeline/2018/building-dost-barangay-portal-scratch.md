# 2018: The "It Works on My Machine" Era

## DOST: Barangay Portal

**Role:** Co-Lead Developer (Internship)  
**Tech Stack:** PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, Google Maps API

### The Story

This was my first real taste of software engineering. No tutorials, no hand-holding—just a problem statement: _"We need to digitize barangay records."_

We built the entire system **from scratch**.
I vividly remember the feeling of uploading the code to a live server for the first time. It wasn't just running on `localhost` anymore; real people at DOST Urdaneta were going to click these buttons.

### What I Learned

- **Greenfield Development:** Starting with a blank text editor is both terrifying and liberating.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Sitting next to the users (barangay officials) taught me that what makes sense to a developer often confuses a user.
- **The "Full Stack" Experience:** I had to be the DBA, the backend dev, the frontend designer, and the deployment engineer all at once.
