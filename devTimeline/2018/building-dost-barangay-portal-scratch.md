## 📅 2018 — Internship (DOST Urdaneta)

**Project:** DOST: Barangay Portal

During my internship at **DOST Urdaneta**, I embarked on my first real coding adventure as a **co-lead developer**. Together with the team, we built **DOST: Barangay Portal** entirely **from scratch**—no legacy data, no pre-existing system—just ideas, determination, and plenty of coffee ☕.

**What I Did:**

- Co-led the development, designing the system architecture from the ground up
- Built dynamic features and CRUD operations using **PHP & MySQL**
- Created responsive interfaces with **Bootstrap**
- Added interactivity and mapped barangay locations using **JavaScript & Google Maps**
- Collaborated closely with stakeholders to clarify requirements and refine features in real-time

**Tech Stack:**

- PHP
- MySQL
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Google Maps API

**Key Takeaway:**

> Leading a project from zero to a fully working system taught me the value of clear architecture, teamwork, and hands-on problem solving in real-world software development.
